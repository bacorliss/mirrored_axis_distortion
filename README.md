# Mirror Axis Distortion
A new visualization for fold change data that combines the directional symmetry of log plots with the linear mapping of linear plots.


This repository contains code to reproduce the figures from: 
<br>
[1] **MAD-FC: A Fold Change Visualization with Readability, Proportionality, and Symmetry**
<br>
*Bruce A. Corliss, Yaotian Wang, Francis P. Driscoll, Heman Shakeri, Philip E. Bourne*
<br>
Preprint: https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10829


Code for the transform is found in /R/mirrored_axis_distortion.R
<br>
This code will be converted to an r package shortly

All figures found in [1] can be reproduced with scripts found in /mirror_fc/.

Note: to run scripts, run "set_wd_here.R" to set the working directory to the base path of this repository.
